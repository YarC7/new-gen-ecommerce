// Customer Account GraphQL Queries
// Placeholder file to prevent GraphQL codegen warnings

// When you're ready to implement customer accounts, add your queries here:
// - Customer login/logout
// - Customer profile
// - Order history
// - Address management

// Example customer query (commented out until needed):
/*
export const CUSTOMER_QUERY = `#graphql
  query Customer {
    customer {
      id
      email
      firstName
      lastName
      displayName
    }
  }
` as const;
*/
